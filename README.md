The security solution addresses data security and handling, auditing, regulatory compliance, configuring and maintaining access control, monitoring and logging 
suspicioius behavior, managing sensitive data, and handling security assessment and compliance.  

This project is based on a banking model made up of four departments : IT, Accounting/Finance/Lending, Customer Service, and Internal Auditing/Compliance.

The project makes use of several Amazon Web Service features, including AWS Key Management Service (KMS), Identity Access Management (IAM), AWS Audit Manager, 
Amazon Macie, Amazon CloudTrail, Amazon S3, and Amazon Artifact. 

Implementation instructions, explanations, and documentation are included in the wiki.
In order to implement the project, users must have full access to Amazon Web Services.
